<h2 id='savetofile'>Save to File <img src='./img/twotone_save_black_18dp.png' height='32' width='32'></img></h2>

In order to do this, simply click the <b>Save Code in Editor</b> button. Select a filename and then press OK. </p>

<p>Click the <b>Search Code</b> button to pop open a small text entry field below the Codehort toolbar. Entering a string into this field and then pressing Enter/Return will cause all instances of that string to highlight in the editor. Regular expressions are supported and by default the Search functionality is not case-sensitive. </p>

Then enter a second string (this will be the new text) and then press Enter a second time. The editor will then navigate to each instance of the first string entered.
